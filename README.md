# flask-webcam-app

This is a simple Flask app that reads in input from your camera and displays a video feed.
This was done in the context of McGillAI's MAIS202 bootcamp to help students with their final projects.

This simple Flask app detects faces in the camera feed using opencv's haar cascades, but can be modified to use any other model.

## installation

Install the necessary packages using the following command

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## run the app

To run the application,

```
python app.py
```
